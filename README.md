# CBS-variants
Variants of Conflict-Based Search.
 
 The code requires the external library BOOST (https://www.boost.org/).
 
 The current version includes vinilla CBS, ICBS (i.e., CBS with conflict prioritization), CBS with heuristics (including CG, DG and WDG heuristics) and CBS with symmetry reasoning (including rectangle, corridor and target reasoning).
 
## To do:

1. Add disjoint splitting -- done with the main framework, but still need different agent selection strategies and the landmark method.

2. Add sipp (or scipp)

3. Add bypassing

4. Add random restart
