## To do:

1. Add disjoint splitting -- done with the main framework, but still need different agent selection strategies and the landmark method.

2. Add sipp (or scipp)

3. Add bypassing -- done with BP1. Do we need BP2 in https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/749b4b_6c85984d14ff4379b3a4400aab955b7b.pdf?

4. Add random restart -- done with the random permutation of the orders of agents that plan paths at the root node.

5. Add Cardinal Rectangle Reasoning, Rectangle Reasoning and the improved version of Rectangle Reasoning with MDDs.
